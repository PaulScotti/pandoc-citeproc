TODO:

- complete README
- for operations that read biblio files or csl, make error reporting
  better; even better: have the functions return an Either
- document csl-abbrevs here
- document ~/.csl
- add something about this module to pandoc's INSTALL instructions
- improve "not found" behavior in citeproc-hs:
  - use nicer "???" for citations
  - or change types so warnings can be omitted
