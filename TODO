TODO:

- better error reporting around readBiblioFile, which fails
  with a cryptic fopen message
  pandoc-citeproc: fopen: : does not exist (No such file or directory)
  if the file doesn't exist. sim for csl, csl-abbrevs.  make this robust.
- add some tests to this module (tests previously in pandoc?)
  (see tests directory)
- allow YAML version of csl-abbrevs.  document here and in pandoc README.
- improve "not found" behavior in citeproc-hs:
  - use nicer "???" for citations
  - or change types so warnings can be omitted
- add something about this module to pandoc's INSTALL instructions
