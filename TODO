TODO:

- complete README
- for operations that read biblio files or csl, make error reporting
  better; even better: have the functions return an Either
- allow YAML version of csl-abbrevs.  document here and in pandoc README.
- improve "not found" behavior in citeproc-hs:
  - use nicer "???" for citations
  - or change types so warnings can be omitted
- add something about this module to pandoc's INSTALL instructions
